    In this case our backtest results in a Sharpe ratio of 0.59 over a decade while the Sharpe ratio of SP500 is 0.8 during the same period. This may be due to several reasons:
    <ol>
        <li>The number of stocks in the portfolio might be not enough.</li>
        <li>Equal weights for all stocks might not fully display the strength of the stocks rank higher.</li>
        <li>The rebalance frequency might be too short for a momentum strategy in equities.</li>
    </ol>
    However, this tutorial shows us how to take advantage of the techniques of requesting historical data and using Rolling Windows. We hope the community further develop greater strategies based on these techniques.
