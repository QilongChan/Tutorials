  In this tutorial, we will develop a strategy based on the price and earnings momentum effect of stocks. This strategy is derived from the paper <a target=_BLANK href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=299107"> "Momentum"</a> by N.Jegadeesh and S.Titman.

  From the paper, N.Jegadeesh et al. indicate that stocks that perform the best (worst) over a three to twelve month period tend to continue to perform well (poorly) over the subsequent three to twelve months, which is the price/return momentum. Besides, stocks with high earnings per share outperform stocks with low ones, which is the earnings momentum. Therefore, we could initiate a quarterly-rebalanced stock strategy based on the price and earnings momentum.
